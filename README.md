# 2024 Olympic Medal Prediction

## Objective 
Our project seeks to aggregate data from Olympics 2012, 2016 and 2021 via a linear regression model to predict the number of medals that each country won when competing ing the 2024 Olympics. 

## Method
We chose Python as our programming language of choice, using libraries from Matplotlib, Pandas and Numpy to analyze our code and deploy them using Google Colab. By visualizing our data and predicting the trend using **linear regression model**, we predicted that the United States would win the most medals out of all of the countries.

## Challenges
**Getting Google Colab to work**: We were unable to work on the same files with each other. To solve this solution, we worked on separate documents, which ultimately made collaboration easier.
**Workload distribution:** we were running a bit late on time and had to resort to all-nighters.

# ðŸ¥‡ 2024 Olympic Medal Prediction ðŸ¥‡

## Objective 
Our project seeks to aggregate data from Olympics 2012, 2016 and 2021 via a linear regression model to predict the number of medals that each country would win during the 2024 Olympics. 

## Method
We chose Python as our programming language of choice, using libraries from Matplotlib, Pandas and Numpy to analyze our code and deploying them using Google Colab. By visualizing our data and predicting the trend using a **linear regression model**, we predicted that the United States would win the most medals out of all of the countries.

## Challenges
**Google Colab Issues**: We were unable to work on the same files with each other. To solve this solution, we worked on separate documents, which ultimately made collaboration easier.
**Time Constraints:** We were running a bit late on time and had to resort to all-nighters.

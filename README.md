# 2024 Olympic Medal Prediction

## Objective 
Our project seeks to concatenate data from Olympics 2012, 2016 and 2021 to predict the results (number of medals) for athletes competing in the 2024 Olympics, categorized into Bronze, Silver and Gold Medals. 

## Method
For our code, we used Python with libraries from Matplotlib, Pandas and Numpy to analyze our code and deploy them using Jupyter Notebooks on Google Colab. By visualizing our data and predicting the trend using **linear regression model**, we predict the athlete medallists by their countries and number of prizes they might win.

## Challenges
Getting Google Colab to work. We were unable to work on the same files with each other. To solve this solution, we worked on separate documents, which ultimately made collaboration easier.
Workload distribution: we were running a bit late on time and had to resort to all-nighters.
